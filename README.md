# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

        I created this web application to help better my and other's
    futures with the Vanderbilt coding bootcamp. I conceived this project so I would have a place to compile my notes throughout my prework journey and so I could easily reflect on these notes at any point. This was further published so that other new developers may be able to gather information that they may need from my notes and help them along their own journey. I learned an abuncance of new things throughout this project. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Further, I gained some essential knowledge about the fundamentals of coding and developing to help kickstart my learning with this bootcamp.

    This study guide can be used to simply add to your own notes, or you could use this guide as a guidance to start your own. Each section of the guide contains information about each of the basic languages I learned about throughout my prework as previously mentioned. You also can open the DevTools console to see the JavaScript I coded actually running! You may also be able to use this part to tell you what to study next in my guide.
